# Implementation Details

  * Inside your class, use `implements [interface class name]`. That provides an interface behavior, enforcing
  the implementation of mandatory methods. Different operators, different interfaces, take a look inside the folder of your
  type of operator and see what is being used (you can identify it looking for a file who name ends with `interface`);
  * Organize algorithm class inside modules (e.g., `RandomSwap` class);
  * `initialize` have no arguments.
